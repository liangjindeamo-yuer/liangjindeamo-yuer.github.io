I am a Ph.D student of the <a href="https://minds.sjtu.edu.cn/">  Mobile Intelligent Networks and Systems (Minds) Lab </a>, Shanghai, since 2022. And I received the B.Eng major in Information Security from <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in 2022. And currently, research on the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, mobile computing and security has been my ongoing pursuit.
