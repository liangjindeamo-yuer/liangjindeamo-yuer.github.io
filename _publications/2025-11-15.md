excerpt: 'We propose a novel edge-to-server audio streaming architecture that leverages Mel filter bank spectral features to achieve ultra-high compression efficiency. Our system integrates audio denoising, Mel feature extraction,and quantization-based compression at the edge, effectively suppressing environmental and device-induced noise while achieving an extreme compression ratio relative to the original uncompressed audio.
