excerpt: 'We leverage a 3D-printed passive acoustic metasurface to significantly enhance the diversity of the measurement data, thereby improving the imaging quality. Specifically, we jointly design the transmission signal, transceivers beamforming weights, metasurface, and imaging algorithm to minimize the imaging reconstruction error in an end-to-end manner.'
